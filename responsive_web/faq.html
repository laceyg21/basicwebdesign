                 <h2>1. What is a Savannah cat?</h2>
                 <p>A Savannah cat is a hybrid breed, a cross between a domestic cat and a wild African serval. They are known for their tall, lean bodies, spotted coats, and energetic personalities.</p>
                 <h2>2. Are Savannah cats legal everywhere?</h2>
                 <p>Laws vary depending on your state, country, or even city. Some areas restrict ownership of certain generations (especially F1–F3), so always check local regulations before getting a Savannah cat.</p>
                 <h2>3. What’s the difference between F1, F2, F3, etc.?</h2>
                 <h3>These refer to the generation — how far removed the cat is from the serval ancestor:</h3>
                 <ul>
                 <li>F1: 50% serval, usually the largest and wildest.</li>
                 <li>F2–F3: Still very exotic-looking, but more domestic in behavior.</li>
                 <li>F4 and beyond: Considered fully domestic by most standards.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h2>4. Do Savannah cats make good pets?</h2>
                 <p>Yes — for the right person. They're intelligent, playful, loyal, and can bond deeply with their owners. But they also require more stimulation and space than a typical house cat.</p>
                 <h2>5. Do they get along with other pets?</h2>
                 <p>It depends on the individual cat and how they’re raised. Many Savannahs can get along with dogs and other cats if properly socialized early on.</p>

                 <h2>6. Are Savannah cats hypoallergenic?</h2>
                 <p>No cat is truly hypoallergenic, but some owners with mild allergies report fewer issues with Savannahs. Still, it varies from person to person.</p>
                 <h2>7. How big do Savannah cats get?</h2>
                 <p>F1–F2 males can weigh 17–25+ pounds and stand up to 17 inches tall at the shoulder. Later generations are smaller, but still larger than average domestic cats.</p>
                 <h2>8. Do they need special care?</h2>
                 <h3>Yes. They benefit from:</h3>
                 <ul>
                  <li>A high-protein diet (often raw or premium wet food)</li>
                  <li>Regular play and enrichment</li>
                  <li>Safe outdoor access (catios or leash walks)</li>
                  <li>Vet care with someone familiar with hybrids</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h2>9. Are they good with kids?</h2>
                 <p>Older kids who understand boundaries usually do great with Savannahs. Younger children may need supervision, as these cats are high-energy and don’t always love being handled roughly.</p>
                 <h2>10. Can Savannah cats be trained?</h2>
                 <p>Absolutely! They’re smart and can learn tricks, walk on a leash, and even use puzzle feeders. Training with positive reinforcement works best.</p>
