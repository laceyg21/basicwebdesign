                <li>Interactive playtime (puzzle toys, laser pointers)</li>
                <li>High-protein diet (similar to a raw food diet)</li>

            </ul>
            <h2 class="heading_style">Are Savannah Cats Right for You?</h2>
            <p>Savannah cats are high-energy, intelligent, and social felines that require plenty of attention and stimulation. They thrive in homes with ample space, such as those with cat trees, climbing shelves, or outdoor enclosures. Unlike typical domestic cats, they love to play, explore, and even walk on a leash, making them great for active owners. Their loyal and dog-like nature means they often follow their humans around and enjoy interaction. However, they can be demanding and may not tolerate being left alone for long periods. Early-generation Savannahs (F1-F2) require experienced cat owners, while later generations (F3-F5) are more manageable as pets. They need a high-protein diet, regular exercise, and mental stimulation to stay happy and healthy. If you’re looking for a unique, affectionate, and highly interactive companion, a Savannah cat might be the perfect fit for you!</p>
