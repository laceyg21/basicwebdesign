        <h1>LG Digital Media & Design</h1>
        <p> Hello there! I'm Lacey, a 20-year-old college student with a passion for capturing moments through photography, bringing characters to life through digital sculpting, and creating animations that tell stories. As a student photographer, digital character sculptor, and animator, I pour my creativity and dedication into every project! When I'm not behind the camera or immersed in the world of digital art, you can find me cuddling with my beloved feline companions. As a cat lover, these furry friends hold a special place in my heart and often inspire my creative enderavors. Join me on this artisticc journey as I navigate the world of visual storytelling and continue to learn and grow as a multifaceted artist. Thank you for stopping by to learn a little more about me!</p>
